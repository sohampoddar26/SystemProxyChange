# SystemProxyChange
This script has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04, but will definitely work with other versions too. It is untested for other linux versions.
Keep the script in one of the directories listed in path to seamlessly use it (for eg. /usr/local/bin/). 
Else you need to run it with the complete address.  
To run it, type beeProxy in the terminal and press enter.

Usage:  
type *beeProxy -h* or *beeProxy -help* to view usage.  
simply typing *beeProxy* will show the status of proxy.  
type *beeProxy on*, *beeProxy off* or *beeProxy toggle* to change settings.
*beeProxy t* can be used in place of *beeProxy toggle*.

the proxy address and proxy port can be given as the second and third parameters respectively.  
eg: *beeProxy on 10.32.0.1 8080*
